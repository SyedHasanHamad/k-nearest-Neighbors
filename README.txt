With a nuanced understanding of the data, we proceed to construct classification models using 
two distinct methodologies: Linear Regression and k-nearest Neighbors (KNN). These models 
are designed to learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to 
predict whether a given digit belongs to class "2" or "7."
